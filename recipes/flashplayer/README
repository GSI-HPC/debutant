The flashplugin-nonfree package ceased to exist.
Therefore this recipe jumps in and builds a package.

It utilizes the alternative system for flash-mozilla.so

TODO:
Add a privacy-optimized preconfiguration if possible.
Test upgrading from within flash-player-properties.

Skip KDE4 stuff for everything but Jessie.
